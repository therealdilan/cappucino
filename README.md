# Cappuccino
 

 Cappuccino is a completely useless, live web render, letting you write HTML, CSS and JavaScript and watch it render in (almost) realtime. 

 I plan to add more features soon to actually make it seem like a worthwhile project, such as local savings, providing CSS styles, downloading as HTML files etc. 

 If you want to try it out, you can [here](https://cappucino.fly.dev/). It's less impressive than it sounds!

 ## Future Features:

 - Download as HTML file
 - Pre-add CSS styles
 - Tailwind support
 - Turn off Javascript 
 - Save between sessions
 - Rename everything to 'Cappuccino' (I forgot the extra 'c')
